  <h1><font color='brown'> What is a Resignation Letter?
A Resignation Letter is a formal letter informing your employer of your decision to resign from your job. Resignation Letters are used by employees who want to leave their employment.
When should I use a Resignation Letter?
Use this Resignation Letter to resign from your job:
to take up a new job
for personal reasons (eg to spend more time with your family), or
because you simply no longer enjoy the job or itâ€™s no longer a good fit for you (eg if your circumstances have changed and you want to find a remote role) <fon></h1>
